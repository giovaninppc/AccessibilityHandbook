An iOS Accessibility guide, demonstrating several accessibility features, how to use and how to implement them with examples in UIKit and SwiftUI.

## About

The Accessibility Handbook started as an idea with some colleagues and friends, aiming to be an easy way to learn more about iOS accessibility features and how to implement them.

### Guides

Find an extensive documentation of accessibility features and options with real examples so you can try them for yourself while using the app.

Also, code examples of how to implement each of them directly on the app!
You don't need to open the source code to take a quick look on the syntaxes, or just to just remind how to implement something.

### The Handbook Game

The **Handbook Game** is a series of short puzzles to test your accessibility knowledge.
They are built not to be hard, but to be examples of how some accessibility settings can be used and how they impact the users.
